## 📈 Coverage Journey

### Starting Point
- **Coverage:** 99% (210/211 statements)
- **Missing:** 1 line in `connector.py:125`
- **Reason:** Unreachable defensive fallback code

### The Issue

**Line 125 in `connector.py`:**
```python
# This should never be reached, but just in case
return subprocess.CompletedProcess(cmd, 1, "", "Max retries exceeded")
```

**Why uncovered:**
- Safety fallback after retry loop
- Theoretically unreachable in normal execution
- Defensive programming best practice

### The Solution

**Added coverage exclusion annotation:**
```python
# This should never be reached, but just in case
return subprocess.CompletedProcess(
    cmd, 1, "", "Max retries exceeded"
)  # pragma: no cover
```

**Result:** Coverage increased from 99% → 100%

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### What Makes This Special

**Not just hitting 100%:**
- Real, comprehensive testing
- Meaningful test cases
- Error scenarios covered
- Performance validated
- Robust retry logic

**Quality indicators:**
1. Tests catch real bugs (proven during debugging)
2. Tests validate behavior, not just lines
3. Integration tests verify actual OrbStack operations
4. Benchmark tests track performance
5. E2E tests validate complete workflows

### Lessons Learned

**From 99% to 100%:**
1. ✅ Identify truly unreachable code
2. ✅ Document why it's unreachable
3. ✅ Use `pragma: no cover` appropriately
4. ✅ Don't test the impossible
5. ✅ Focus on meaningful coverage

**The annotation:**
```python
)  # pragma: no cover
```
- Simple and standard
- Recognized by coverage tools
- Documents intentional exclusion
- Doesn't hide important gaps

---

## 🎯 Maintenance

### Keeping 100% Coverage

**Regular practices:**

1. **Run tests before committing:**
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src/pyinfra_orbstack
   ```

2. **Review coverage reports:**
   ```bash
   open htmlcov/index.html
   ```

3. **Add tests for new code:**
   - Write tests alongside features
   - Verify coverage increases
   - Check edge cases

4. **Monitor coverage trends:**
   - Track in CI/CD
   - Alert on decreases
   - Celebrate increases

### When to Use `pragma: no cover`

**Appropriate uses:**
- ✅ Defensive fallbacks (like ours)
- ✅ Platform-specific code not testable
- ✅ Debug-only code
- ✅ Truly unreachable paths

**Inappropriate uses:**
- ❌ Difficult-to-test code
- ❌ Lazy workarounds
- ❌ Missing test cases
- ❌ Complex logic

**Rule of thumb:** If code can execute in practice, test it. Only exclude what's theoretically impossible.

## 📝 Technical Details

### The Pragma Comment

**What it does:**
- Tells coverage.py to ignore the line
- Excluded from coverage calculations
- Standard coverage tool directive

**Syntax:**
```python
code_line()  # pragma: no cover
```

**Documentation:**
```python
# This should never be reached, but just in case
return subprocess.CompletedProcess(
    cmd, 1, "", "Max retries exceeded"
)  # pragma: no cover
```

### Coverage Configuration

**In `pyproject.toml`:**
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
addopts = [
    "--cov=src/pyinfra_orbstack",
    "--cov-report=term-missing",
    "--cov-report=html",
]
```

**Coverage runs:**
- Automatically with pytest
- Generates multiple reports
- Shows missing lines
- Creates HTML visualization
