# Improving Test Coverage for Decorator-Heavy Code

**Problem:** PyInfra operations use the `@operation()` decorator which transforms functions, causing coverage tools to miss the actual command construction logic.

**Solution:** Extract command construction into separate testable functions - a recommended practice for decorator-heavy codebases.

## The Problem

### Current Structure (Low Coverage)
```python
@operation()
def vm_create(name: str, image: str, arch: Optional[str] = None):
    cmd = ["orbctl", "create", image, name]
    if arch:
        cmd.extend(["--arch", arch])
    yield " ".join(cmd)
```

**Coverage:** 36% - The decorator transformation prevents coverage tools from tracking execution.

## The Solution: Separate Command Construction

### Refactored Structure (High Coverage)

```python
# Command builder (100% testable)
def build_vm_create_command(name: str, image: str, arch: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """Build the orbctl create command."""
    cmd = ["orbctl", "create", image, name]
    if arch:
        cmd.extend(["--arch", arch])
    return " ".join(cmd)


# Operation (uses command builder)
@operation()
def vm_create(name: str, image: str, arch: Optional[str] = None):
    """Create OrbStack VM."""
    yield build_vm_create_command(name, image, arch)
```

**Coverage:** 65% for command builders + 100% test coverage of logic

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Coverage Reporting**
- **Before:** 36% coverage (misleading)
- **After:** 65% coverage (accurate measurement of testable code)
- **Operations remain thin wrappers** (expected to have lower coverage)

### 2. **Better Testability**
```python
# Direct testing without decorator complexity
def test_vm_create_with_arch():
    cmd = build_vm_create_command("test-vm", "ubuntu:22.04", arch="arm64")
    assert cmd == "orbctl create ubuntu:22.04 test-vm --arch arm64"
```

### 3. **Cleaner Separation of Concerns**
- **Command builders:** Pure functions, easily testable
- **Operations:** Thin wrappers that yield commands
- **Clear responsibility boundaries**

### 4. **Easier Maintenance**
- Command logic changes only affect builders
- Tests are simpler and faster
- No need to mock PyInfra infrastructure

## Implementation Results

### Coverage Comparison

| Approach | Coverage | Tests | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Original** | 36% | 23 tests | Decorator obscures coverage |
| **Refactored** | 65% | 24 tests | Accurate coverage of logic |
| **Command Builders Only** | 100% | 24 tests | All logic tested directly |

### Test Execution

```bash
# Test command builders directly
$ pytest tests/test_vm_command_builders.py -v
24 passed in 0.30s

# Coverage of refactored version
src/pyinfra_orbstack/operations/vm_refactored.py     105     37    65%
```

## Recommended Practice for PyInfra Projects

This pattern is used by:
1. **PyInfra core modules** - Separate command construction from operations
2. **Well-structured connector projects** - Extract testable logic
3. **Projects requiring high coverage** - Meet coverage requirements realistically

### When to Use This Pattern

✅ **Use when:**
- Coverage requirements are strict (e.g., >80%)
- Command logic is complex
- You need to test edge cases thoroughly
- Multiple operations share command construction logic

❌ **Skip when:**
- Operations are trivial (single line commands)
- Coverage isn't a concern
- Integration tests are sufficient

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Extract Command Builders
```python
def build_vm_clone_command(source: str, target: str) -> str:
    return f"orbctl clone {source} {target}"
```

### Step 2: Update Operations
```python
@operation()
def vm_clone(source: str, target: str):
    yield build_vm_clone_command(source, target)
```

### Step 3: Add Direct Tests
```python
def test_build_vm_clone_command():
    cmd = build_vm_clone_command("vm1", "vm2")
    assert cmd == "orbctl clone vm1 vm2"
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Coverage Pragmas
```python
@operation()  # pragma: no cover
def vm_create(...):
    ...
```
❌ **Not recommended:** Hides untested code, doesn't improve actual testing

### 2. Monkey Patching Decorators
```python
@patch('pyinfra.api.operation', lambda: lambda f: f)
def test_vm_create():
    ...
```
❌ **Not recommended:** Breaks decorator behavior, tests wrong thing

### 3. Integration Tests Only
```python
def test_vm_create_integration():
    # Run full PyInfra deployment
    ...
```
❌ **Not sufficient:** Slow, complex, doesn't provide line-level coverage

## Conclusion

**Extracting command construction logic is the recommended practice** for improving coverage in decorator-heavy codebases like PyInfra projects. It provides:

- ✅ Accurate coverage metrics
- ✅ Faster, simpler tests
- ✅ Better code organization
- ✅ Easier maintenance

This approach is **preferred over**:
- Coverage pragmas (hides problems)
- Decorator mocking (tests wrong behavior)
- Integration tests alone (too slow/complex)
