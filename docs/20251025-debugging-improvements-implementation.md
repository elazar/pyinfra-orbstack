# Debugging Improvements Implementation

**Date:** October 24, 2025, 2:45 PM CDT
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive debugging and diagnostics improvements to help identify the root cause of OrbStack VM creation timeouts.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Error Message Logging ✅

**File:** `tests/test_utils.py`

**Changes:**

- Added detailed error logging when network errors occur
- Log first 200 characters of error message on retry attempts
- Log first 500 characters of error message on final failure

**Code Added:**

```python
# On retry attempts (lines 247-250)
if result.stderr:
    error_preview = result.stderr[:200].replace('\n', ' ')
    print(f"  Error details: {error_preview}")

# On final failure (lines 256-258)
if result.stderr:
    error_preview = result.stderr[:500].replace('\n', ' ')
    print(f"  Final error: {error_preview}")
```

**Impact:** Next test run will show actual OrbStack error messages, revealing what's really happening.

### 2. Timeout Diagnostics ✅

**File:** `tests/test_utils.py`

**Changes:**

- Enhanced timeout logging with actual timeout duration
- Added command logging to see exact command that timed out
- Added OrbStack health check after timeout
- Log total time waited after all retry attempts fail

**Code Added:**

```python
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired as e:
    if attempt < max_retries:
        delay = base_delay * (2**attempt)
        print(f"{operation_name} timed out after {timeout}s, retrying in {delay}s")
        print(f"  Command: {' '.join(cmd)}")
        # Check if OrbStack is still responsive
        try:
            health_check = subprocess.run(
                ["orbctl", "status"],
                capture_output=True,
                text=True,
                timeout=5
            )
            if health_check.returncode == 0:
                print("  OrbStack is responsive (status OK)")
            else:
                print("  Warning: OrbStack status check failed")
        except Exception:
            print("  Warning: OrbStack appears unresponsive")
        time.sleep(delay)
        continue
    else:
        print(f"{operation_name} timed out after {max_retries + 1} attempts")
        print(f"  Total time waited: {timeout * (max_retries + 1)}s")
        raise e
```

**Impact:** Will tell us if OrbStack is still responsive after timeout, helping distinguish between OrbStack hangs vs. subprocess issues.

### 3. OrbStack Health Check Function ✅

**File:** `tests/test_utils.py`

**Changes:**

- New `check_orbstack_healthy()` function
- Performs quick `orbctl list` operation with 5s timeout
- Returns tuple of (is_healthy, status_message)

**Code Added:**

```python
def check_orbstack_healthy() -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Check if OrbStack is healthy and responsive.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (is_healthy, status_message)
    """
    try:
        # Quick list operation to verify OrbStack is responsive
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["orbctl", "list", "--format", "json"],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            timeout=5
        )
        if result.returncode == 0:
            return True, "OrbStack is healthy"
        else:
            return False, f"OrbStack list failed: {result.stderr[:100]}"
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        return False, "OrbStack is unresponsive (timeout)"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"OrbStack check failed: {str(e)[:100]}"
```

**Impact:** Can detect OrbStack problems before attempting VM creation.

### 4. Pre-Creation Health Check ✅

**File:** `tests/test_utils.py`

**Changes:**

- Call `check_orbstack_healthy()` before every VM creation
- Log warning if OrbStack appears unhealthy
- Proceed with creation anyway (don't block tests)

**Code Added:**

```python
def create_vm_with_retry(...):
    # Check OrbStack health before attempting VM creation
    is_healthy, health_msg = check_orbstack_healthy()
    if not is_healthy:
        print(f"Warning: {health_msg}")
        print("  Proceeding with VM creation anyway...")

    # ... rest of function
```

**Impact:** Will alert us if OrbStack is already in a bad state before VM creation starts.

## What We'll Learn from Next Test Run

### Expected Output on Failure

**Before (previous output):**

```text
Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 1/4)
VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) timed out, retrying in 2.0s
Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 2/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-1761332763), retrying in 4.0s
Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 3/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-1761332763), retrying in 8.0s
Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 4/4)
VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) failed after 4 attempts
```

**After (new output will include):**

```text
Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 1/4)
VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) timed out after 180s, retrying in 2.0s
  Command: orbctl create ubuntu:22.04 test-vm-1761332763
  OrbStack is responsive (status OK)

Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 2/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-1761332763), retrying in 4.0s
  Error details: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address

Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 3/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-1761332763), retrying in 8.0s
  Error details: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address

Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) (attempt 4/4)
VM creation (test-vm-1761332763) failed after 4 attempts
  Final error: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address (full context here)
```

### Key Information We'll Get

1. **Actual OrbStack error message** - What is OrbStack actually saying?
2. **OrbStack responsiveness** - Is OrbStack still working after timeout?
3. **Exact command** - Which command timed out?
4. **Total time** - How long did we actually wait?

## Verification

### Code Quality ✅

- ✅ All linter warnings fixed (except pre-existing cognitive complexity)
- ✅ Type hints correct (`tuple[bool, str]`)
- ✅ Exception handling proper (`except Exception:` with comment)
- ✅ No bare string formatting (f-strings only where needed)

### Functionality ✅

- ✅ Verified with single test run (no regressions)
- ✅ Code compiles without syntax errors
- ✅ Import statements correct
- ✅ Function signatures match usage

## Next Steps

### To Trigger Enhanced Logging

Run the full test suite or just the failing tests:

```bash
# Full suite
uv run pytest -v --timeout=180

# Just the failing tests
uv run pytest tests/test_vm_operations_integration.py::TestVMOperationsIntegration::test_vm_info_integration -v --timeout=180
```

### Expected Outcomes

**If OrbStack is unresponsive:**

```text
Warning: OrbStack is unresponsive (timeout)
  Proceeding with VM creation anyway...
```

**If VM creation hits specific error:**

```text
Error details: [actual OrbStack error message here]
```

**If OrbStack becomes unresponsive during creation:**

```text
VM creation timed out after 180s, retrying in 2.0s
  Command: orbctl create ubuntu:22.04 test-vm-...
  Warning: OrbStack appears unresponsive
```

### Analysis After Next Run

With the actual error messages, we can:

1. **Identify the specific OrbStack error** (e.g., "timeout waiting for IP", "resource exhausted", etc.)
2. **Determine if OrbStack is responsive** during/after failures
3. **Understand the timeline** of the failure
4. **Make informed decisions** about next steps

## Potential Root Causes (Updated with Better Diagnostics)

Based on what the enhanced logging might reveal:

### Error: "timeout waiting for IP address"

**Root Cause:** VM networking setup failed
**Solution:** Check OrbStack networking configuration, restart OrbStack

### Error: "resource exhausted" or "no space left"

**Root Cause:** OrbStack resource limits hit
**Solution:** Increase limits, clean up VMs, restart OrbStack

### Error: "image pull failed" or "download timeout"

**Root Cause:** Image download issues
**Solution:** Pre-pull images, check network

### OrbStack becomes unresponsive

**Root Cause:** OrbStack process deadlock
**Solution:** Restart OrbStack, report bug to OrbStack team

### No error message (empty stderr)

**Root Cause:** Silent hang in OrbStack
**Solution:** Check OrbStack logs, restart OrbStack

## Summary

**Changes Made:**

- 4 improvements to `tests/test_utils.py`
- ~70 lines of new code
- 0 breaking changes
- 0 test failures

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Will show actual OrbStack error messages
- ✅ Will detect OrbStack health issues before VM creation
- ✅ Will show if OrbStack is responsive after timeouts
- ✅ Will provide detailed timeline of failures

**Next Action:** Run tests and analyze the enhanced diagnostic output to determine root cause.
