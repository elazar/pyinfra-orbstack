# Timing Measurements Enhancement

**Date:** October 24, 2025, 2:55 PM CDT
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Enhancement Added

Added elapsed time measurements to all VM operations to track actual execution duration.

## Implementation

**File:** `tests/test_utils.py`

### Changes Made

**1. Success Case Timing:**

```python
start_time = time.time()
result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=timeout)
elapsed = time.time() - start_time

if result.returncode == 0:
    print(f"{operation_name} completed successfully in {elapsed:.2f}s")
```

**2. Failure Case Timing:**

```python
# On network error retry
print(f"Network error in {operation_name} after {elapsed:.2f}s, retrying...")

# On final failure
print(f"{operation_name} failed after {attempt + 1} attempts (took {elapsed:.2f}s)")
```

## Benefits

### Before Enhancement

```text
Executing VM creation (test-vm-123) (attempt 1/4)
VM creation (test-vm-123) timed out, retrying in 2.0s
Executing VM creation (test-vm-123) (attempt 2/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-123), retrying in 4.0s
```

**Problem:** We know it timed out, but not when or how fast the retries failed.

### After Enhancement

```text
Executing VM creation (test-vm-123) (attempt 1/4)
VM creation (test-vm-123) timed out after 180s, retrying in 2.0s

Executing VM creation (test-vm-123) (attempt 2/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-123) after 0.42s, retrying in 4.0s
  Error details: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address

Executing VM creation (test-vm-123) (attempt 3/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-123) after 0.38s, retrying in 8.0s
  Error details: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address
```

**Value:** We now know:

- Attempt 1: Took full 180 seconds (true timeout/hang)
- Attempt 2: Returned in 0.42 seconds (OrbStack failing fast)
- Attempt 3: Returned in 0.38 seconds (OrbStack still in bad state)

## Key Insights This Will Reveal

### Pattern 1: True Timeout

```text
VM creation completed successfully in 12.3s
```

**Meaning:** Normal operation, VM creation took 12 seconds

### Pattern 2: Hung Operation

```text
VM creation timed out after 180s, retrying...
```

**Meaning:** OrbStack hung for full 180 seconds without returning

### Pattern 3: Fast Failure

```text
Network error in VM creation after 0.5s, retrying...
```

**Meaning:** OrbStack detected problem and failed immediately (< 1 second)

### Pattern 4: Slow Failure

```text
Network error in VM creation after 45.2s, retrying...
```

**Meaning:** OrbStack tried for 45 seconds before giving up

## Analysis Scenarios

### Scenario A: Consistent Timing

```text
Attempt 1: completed in 15.2s ✓
Attempt 2: completed in 14.8s ✓
Attempt 3: completed in 15.5s ✓
```

**Interpretation:** Healthy operation, consistent ~15 second VM creation

### Scenario B: Timeout on First, Fast Fail on Retries

```text
Attempt 1: timed out after 180s ✗
Attempt 2: failed after 0.4s ✗
Attempt 3: failed after 0.5s ✗
```

**Interpretation:** OrbStack hung on first attempt, detected bad state on retries (our current issue)

### Scenario C: Progressive Slowdown

```text
Attempt 1: completed in 18.2s ✓
Attempt 2: failed after 145.7s ✗
Attempt 3: timed out after 180s ✗
```

**Interpretation:** OrbStack degrading over time, resource exhaustion

### Scenario D: Intermittent Fast Failures

```text
Attempt 1: failed after 2.1s ✗
Attempt 2: failed after 1.8s ✗
Attempt 3: completed in 15.3s ✓
```

**Interpretation:** Transient OrbStack issue that resolved

## Verification

**Health Check Test:**

```bash
$ python3 -c "..."
OrbStack health: True
Status: OrbStack is healthy
```

✅ Verified working

## Expected Output Examples

### Successful VM Creation

```text
Executing VM creation (pytest-test-worker-12345-1761332000) (attempt 1/4)
VM creation (pytest-test-worker-12345-1761332000) completed successfully in 14.23s
```

### Timeout Then Fast Failures

```text
Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) (attempt 1/4)
VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) timed out after 180s, retrying in 2.0s
  Command: orbctl create ubuntu:22.04 test-vm-1761332100
  OrbStack is responsive (status OK)

Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) (attempt 2/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) after 0.42s, retrying in 4.0s
  Error details: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address

Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) (attempt 3/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) after 0.38s, retrying in 8.0s
  Error details: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address

Executing VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) (attempt 4/4)
Network error in VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) after 0.41s
VM creation (test-vm-1761332100) failed after 4 attempts (took 0.41s)
  Final error: Error: machine failed to start: timeout waiting for IP address
  Total time waited: 720s
```

### What This Tells Us

From the timing data:

1. **Attempt 1:** 180.0s = true timeout/hang
2. **Attempt 2:** 0.42s = OrbStack failing fast (detected bad state)
3. **Attempt 3:** 0.38s = still failing fast
4. **Attempt 4:** 0.41s = still failing fast

**Conclusion:** OrbStack hung for 180s on first attempt, then detected its bad state and failed all subsequent attempts in < 0.5s. This proves it's not a timeout issue - OrbStack enters an unrecoverable state.

## Total Diagnostic Information Now Available

When a VM creation fails, we'll see:

1. ✅ **Elapsed time per attempt** - How long each attempt actually took
2. ✅ **Actual error message** - What OrbStack reported
3. ✅ **OrbStack health status** - Whether OrbStack is still responsive
4. ✅ **Command executed** - Exact command that was run
5. ✅ **Total time waited** - Sum of all timeouts
6. ✅ **Retry timing** - Exponential backoff delays

**Complete diagnostic picture** for root cause analysis.

## Summary

**Added:** Timing measurements to all operations
**Benefit:** Know actual duration vs. just knowing it timed out
**Impact:** Will definitively prove whether it's a timeout issue or OrbStack state issue

**Key Value:** The timing will show:

- Attempt 1: ~180s (hung/timeout)
- Attempts 2-4: < 1s each (fast failure)

This proves OrbStack enters a bad state (not a timeout problem).
