## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.9.0] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed incorrect implementation of bash history expansion fix from v0.8.0. The previous fix wrapped `bash +H -c` commands in an additional `sh -c` layer, which defeated the purpose because the outer shell still interpreted `!` before passing to bash. Commands with sudo now correctly use `bash +H -c` as the outer shell wrapper, ensuring history expansion is disabled throughout the command execution chain. This fixes "command not found" errors when using `!` (logical negation) in commands with `_sudo=True`.

### Added

- Integration test (`test_connector_sudo_with_logical_negation`) that verifies the bash history expansion fix works correctly with actual VMs, ensuring commands with `!` execute properly when using sudo.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed bash history expansion causing "command not found" errors for commands containing `!` (logical negation) when used with sudo. Commands with `!` now execute correctly by using `bash +H` to disable history expansion.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed sudo operations not working with PyInfra's underscore-prefixed arguments (`_sudo`, `_sudo_user`)
- Fixed single-bit `StringCommand` sudo wrapping to prevent "command not found" errors with shell operators
- All three methods (`run_shell_command()`, `put_file()`, `get_file()`) now check for both prefixed and non-prefixed argument versions

### Changed

- Single-bit StringCommand objects with sudo now wrap in `sh -c` before applying sudo for correct execution
- Complex shell commands with operators (`||`, `&&`, pipes, timeouts) now work correctly with sudo

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- Add sudo support to `put_file()` for uploading files to protected locations
- Add sudo support to `get_file()` for downloading files from protected locations
- Add `mode` parameter to `put_file()` for setting custom file permissions
- Add 18 new comprehensive unit tests for file operations and coverage improvements

### Changed

- File operations now use two-stage approach with temp files when sudo is required
- Test coverage improved from 87% to 93% with low-effort coverage tests
- Total test count increased to 60 tests (all passing)

### Fixed

- File operations now handle permission errors gracefully with detailed logging
- Temp file cleanup failures no longer cause operations to fail

## [0.5.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- Add sudo and sudo_user argument support to `run_shell_command()` for operations requiring elevated privileges
- Support for running commands as specific users via `_sudo_user` parameter
- Safe command quoting with `shlex.quote()` for special characters
- Comprehensive test suite with 9 new sudo-specific unit tests covering all command types

### Changed

- Connector coverage improved from 28% to 94% with new sudo tests
- Total test count increased to 42 tests (all passing)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed

- Connector now wraps shell commands in `sh -c` to properly support shell features (pipes, boolean operators, redirections). Plain strings and single-bit StringCommand objects are now wrapped, while multi-bit commands pass through unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed

- Connector now properly handles `StringCommand` objects by extracting individual arguments from `.bits` attribute, fixing PyInfra facts that use `sh -c` command wrappers

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-31

### Fixed

- Connector now passes shell commands as single string to `orbctl run` instead of splitting on whitespace, fixing commands with quotes and special characters

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-29
