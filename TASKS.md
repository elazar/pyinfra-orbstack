- Implemented all feasible operations from ADR-002
- Maintained 100% coverage on operations/vm.py (75 total tests passing)
- Comprehensive documentation distinguishing OrbStack vs. PyInfra responsibilities

**Commits:**

- `54298a3` - feat: implement Phase 3A - VM Networking Information Operations
- `51cb522` - feat: implement Phase 3C - VM Logging and Diagnostics

- `f59d346` - docs: add ADR-002 Phase 3 feasibility analysis

**Original Phase 3 Tasks (Not Implemented - See ADR-002):**

The following tasks from the original Phase 3 specification were determined to be
infeasible or architecturally inappropriate during the ADR-002 analysis:

- ❌ VM-to-VM file transfer operations (not supported by OrbStack CLI)
- ❌ Per-VM resource management (OrbStack uses global resource pool)
- ❌ Network interface configuration (auto-configured by OrbStack)
- ❌ Custom VM parameters beyond username (not supported by OrbStack CLI)

These operations either:

1. Are not supported by OrbStack CLI
2. Conflict with PyInfra's architectural model
3. Are better served by standard PyInfra operations

See ADR-002 for complete analysis and recommendations.
